"Asshole" by Autumn Kings:
Da da, da da da da da da da, da da da
(Guess there's an asshole in all of us right)

Nothing wrong with a text and a drive
When I cut to the front of the line
Taking more than a piece of the pie
(Maybe you should check yourself)
Never park in between the lines
And I smoke cigarettes inside
Blow it all in your face and smile
(Maybe you should check yourself)

Can't stop talking (Ya, Ya)
Hit you when I'm walking (Hey Babe)
Won't say sorry (Nop)
You can say it for me

Call me what you want, oh oh
Tell me what I am, am, am

Say it!

A-S-S-H-O-L-E
Spell it out so everybody knows it
One, two, three, Hey everybody

A-S-S-H-O-L-E

Downtown on a monday night
Only job is to get in a fight
PIss drunk, then I post online
(Maybe you should check yourself)
Can calling when I ride
Got a little bit of liquor on my mind
Here comes the pick-up line
(Hey wanna f***?)

Can't stop talking (Ya, Ya)
Hit you when I'm walking (Fuck out my way)
Won't say sorry (I'm not sorry)

"Echo (Ready For War)" by Autumn Kings:
OH YA YA YA YA!

There's a fire all around me
My heart begins to pound
When there's no one left beside me
I do without a doubt

The sweet divine
The flame ignites
The call to rise
I think I hear it

When the silence breaks around me

I'm awake, awake, awake, awake
Awake, awake, awake, awake
I'm awake, awake, awake, awake

Oh Whoa

When I hear the echo coming
I don't stop running
Grab a gun and get ready for war

Screaming like a psycho
Ready to fight for the money
Grab a gun and let’s settle the score
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
Outta control yeah

When I hear the echo coming
I don't stop running
Grab a gun and get ready for war

OH YA YA YA YA

Can I pull through all the pressure?
My body tells me no
But my heart can hear the answer

I'm awake, awake, awake, awake
Awake, awake, awake, awake
I'm awake, awake, awake, awake

Oh Whoa

When I hear the echo coming
I don't stop running
Grab a gun and get ready for war

Screaming like a psycho
Ready to fight for the money
Grab a gun and let’s settle the score
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
Outta control yeah

When I hear the echo coming
I don't stop running
Grab a gun and get ready for war

OH YA YA YA YA

The sweet divine
The flame ignites
The call to rise
I think I hear it

I think I hear it

When I hear the echo coming
I don't stop running
Grab a gun and get ready for war

Screaming like a psycho
Ready to fight for the money
Grab a gun and let’s settle the score
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
Outta control yeah

When I hear the echo coming
I don't stop running
Grab a gun and get ready for war

OH YA YA YA YA

"Dear Mr. Fantasy" by Traffic:
[Chorus]
Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that, you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy (yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything, take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that, you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years
[Guitar Solo]

"POWER" by Autumn Kings:
Okay, okay
This shit going off like a bomb
Off like a bomb
Everybody here’s gonna know this song
Cause I won’t take shit
You know what it is
Never sign a deal if I don’t like it
I’m rippin’ it up
Tearin’ it up
Hollywood pussies are married to drugs
But we are the ones making the buzz
Yeah, yeah

‘Cause I’m winnin’ and I know you got it wrong when you’re coming strong
I can smell the bullshit of a con
If your name is drawn
Talking shit but I can never see you
Or hear you, or feel you, or tell you’re alive
Shoot me point blank, but I’m never gon’ die

Like Eminem, I’m not afraid
Got the upper hand to walk away
Walking away
Fuck what you say
Sick of your bullshit so starting today

I’m sеtting fire to my enemiеs around
To the liars, all the ones who let me down
Through the darkest of hours
I’m gonna take back the power

I’m setting fire to my enemies around
To the liars, all the ones who let me down
Through the darkest of hours
I’m gonna take back the power, power


Okay okay
This shit going off like I’m crazy
Look at y’all, lazy
Cryin’ like a bitch
‘Cause you heard what they pay me
If I had a penny every time I was under your skin
I could bust your brains out, bail myself out the pen
‘Cause we all got somebody on our hit list
Someone who takes a bit of truth and he twists it
But only does it in a text
‘Cause it’s easier to lie
What, you think that I don’t know about business?

Ain’t foolin’ me
You cannot fuck with the king
You cannot fuck with the king
I got a list of my homies
Who ain’t scared of fighting
And trust me, you don’t wanna see
Listen to me
If you persist
Tryna hurt my reputation and shit
I’ll take you to court ’til you can’t feed your kids
Even your lawyers, they say you’re a bitch

I’m setting fire to my enemies around
To the liars, all the ones who let me down
Through the darkest of hours
I’m gonna take back the power

I’m setting fire to my enemies around
To the liars, all the ones who let me down
Through the darkest of hours
I’m gonna take back the power, power


The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows
It’s a very mean and nasty place
And I don’t care how tough you are
It will beat you to your knees
And keep you there permanently if you let it
But it ain’t about how hard you hit
It’s about how hard you can get hit
And keep moving forward


Bleeding
I’m just tryna find a meaning
But my head is full of demons
And they’re always around me
‘round me
Bleeding
I’m just tryna find a meaning
But my head is full of demons
No they’re never gonna drown me, drown me

I’m setting fire to my enemies around
To the liars, all the ones who let me down
Through the darkest of hours
I’m gonna take back the power

I’m setting fire to my enemies around
To the liars, all the ones who let me down
Through the darkest of hours
I will take back the power






I'M STILL FORKING YOU


BOLLOCKS
SHIT
FUCK
CUNT
BITCH
ASS
DAMN
DICK
COCK
PUSSY
THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU, YOU CREEP?!?!
